  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Last updated: February 2026</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Chicken Swipe</strong> (“the App”)
    handles information when you use it. The App is developed and operated by an
    independent developer (“we”, “us”, or “our”).
  </p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Chicken Swipe is a casual arcade game where players control a flying chicken
    using swipe gestures to achieve the highest possible score. We respect your
    privacy and are committed to keeping the App simple and safe to use.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    The App does <strong>not collect</strong>, store, or process any personal data.
    No personal information is transmitted from your device to us or to any third
    parties.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The App may request permission to send local notifications. These notifications
    are created and handled entirely on your device and are not used to collect,
    store, or transmit any personal data.
  </p>

  <h2>Game Center</h2>
  <p>
    Chicken Swipe uses Apple Game Center to provide leaderboards and competitive
    features. Game Center is operated by Apple, and any data processed through
    Game Center is handled according to Apple’s Privacy Policy. We do not receive
    or store personal information related to your Game Center account.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    Chicken Swipe does not store user data on external servers and does not use
    cloud storage, backups, or remote databases.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    Other than Apple Game Center, the App does not use third-party analytics,
    advertising, tracking, or crash reporting services.
  </p>

  <h2>User Accounts</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not require account creation, registration, login, or any form of
    user identification to play. Any optional Game Center participation is managed
    entirely through the user’s Apple ID.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Chicken Swipe does not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    Since the App itself does not collect personal data, no information from users
    of any age is stored or shared by us.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted
    on this page with an updated revision date.
